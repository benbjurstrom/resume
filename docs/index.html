  As a Project Manager my primary responsibilities are to design site architecture and lead development of enterprise web applications. In this role I spend around thirty percent of my time coding with the remaining time spent on code review and breaking projects up into digestible chunks for the engineering team.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  One particularly successful project we worked on is a custom transportation compliance solution enabling paperless administration of commercial driver qualification files. The success of this project doubled the number of transportation services offered by the company and an entire department was staffed to utilize the application.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  I also successfully transitioned the engineering team to a workflow loosely based on agile methodologies, established scalable coding standards, and prioritized automated test coverage. I'm particularly proud of this accomplishment because the company had grown rapidly and there was no existing process to build on. Once in place our new workflow yielded an exponential increase in developer productivity and a decrease in the number of bugs found by our quality assurance team.

  I started this company with the goal of organizing tweets pertaining to sporting events. Though the company ultimately failed as a business we gained invaluable experience and enjoyed a number of successes along the way. We were able to build a product we were proud of, raise funding, and pitch to many large media companies across the country.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  Beyond the business lessons, as the technical founder my responsibilities crossed many different disciplines. This experience left me with a well-rounded understanding of everything from search engine optimization, configuring AWS services, monitoring server load and site traffic, implementing continuous integration techniques, and a plethora of other technical odds and ends that go into launching a web based product.
