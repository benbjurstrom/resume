  As IT Manager my primary responsibility is to oversee the development of enterprise web applications. In this role I'm able to spend around thirty percent of my time assisting with challenging programming and dev-ops problems. The remaining time is spent on requirement gathering with the various business groups, working with our engineering teams on project architecture design, and other duties inherent in managing a large team.

  One particularly successful project we worked on is a custom transportation compliance solution enabling paperless administration of commercial driver qualification files. The success of this project doubled the number of transportation services offered by the company and an entire department was staffed to utilize the application.

  I also successfully established a kubernetes based continuous integration pipeline, transitioned the engineering team to a workflow loosely based on agile methodologies, established scalable coding standards, and prioritized automated test coverage. I'm particularly proud of this accomplishment because the company had grown rapidly and there was no existing process to build on. Once in place our new workflows yielded an exponential increase in developer productivity and a decrease in the number of bugs found by our quality assurance team.
